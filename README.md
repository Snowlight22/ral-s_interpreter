# RAL/S Interpreter
An interpreter for a programming language I created, called RAL/S (Repeating Arithmetic Language System).  It supports only the most basic functionality: basically just basic mathematical expressions and conditional jumps.  Variables and pointers are done on the main memory array, which means they can only have integer values and integer names.  Documentation is included in the `RAL_S_Documentation.txt` file.

I'm not really sure what this is useful for, although it might be good for some really small application, or as a tiny scripting language.

ALERT: The code is really messy!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
